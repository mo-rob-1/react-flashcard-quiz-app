# React Flashcard Quiz App

## Project Overview

The Open Trivia DB API was used to create a flashcard trivia quiz app where the user can filter between different categories of questions and choose the number of questions to display on the screen. The user can then hover over and click on a flashcard to view the answer to a quiz question. Styled Components was used to create a toggle effect where the user can toggle between dark and light mode.
